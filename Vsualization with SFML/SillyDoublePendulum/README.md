Silly Double pendulum. This project just visualizes the double pendulum and there are no physical solvers to integerate the equation of motion.
The code has some bugs though. For example when the second mass gets higher than the first mass, the second line dose not get drown in a good way. However this project can be used to initiate someother visualization projects with SFML.
